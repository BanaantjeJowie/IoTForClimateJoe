    <h1 class ="climateTitle">What is climate change and what are the consequences?</h1>
    <p class="climatePar" style="float: left; max-width: 70%;">
        Climate change is the long-term alteration of Earth's climate due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Its consequences include rising temperatures, melting polar ice, sea level rise, extreme weather events, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, crop failures, water scarcity, health impacts, economic losses, and social disruption. To combat these consequences, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt sustainable practices.
